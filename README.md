# chrome-app-psychedelik.com

A simple chrome app to load up my favorite psytrance internet radio station - [http://psychedelik.com](http://psychedelik.com).

## Usage
This Chrome app is not currently published to the Chrome app store.  Maybe [someday](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish). It's easy to load into Chrome, though.

1. Clone this repository.
1. Open Chrome’s extensions page at [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).
1. Enable the Developer mode checkbox and click the Load unpacked extension button.
1. Browse to this cloned folder on your hard drive and click OK. Chrome will then install it.
1. Open [chrome://apps](chrome://apps). You should see the Psychedelik.com logo.
1. Click it!

### Pro Tips
- I like to right-click on the app icon and select "Open as Pinned Tab" so the tab is small and bounces to the left whenever I open it.
